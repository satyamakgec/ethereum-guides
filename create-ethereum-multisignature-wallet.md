4. Navigate to the 'testnet' folder in the same directory

## How to Import your Accounts and Wallets

**I'm about to tell you to delete your accounts and all the tokens and contracts you're watching. You need to backup all those addresses, json interfaces and data!!!**

2. Delete the entire 'Mist' folder
3. Relaunch the 'Ethereum-Wallet', there should be no wallets there
